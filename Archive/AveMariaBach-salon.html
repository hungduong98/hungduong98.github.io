    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
    It was Christmas 2018, give or take a few days because I know it wasn't on Christmas day just to get more audience. I performed a few pieces which I unfortunately did not record all of them (including my favorite piece that day that I was dying to see how I played).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Ave Maria is an all-time classic, and literally everyone know about this piece. Maria has been the subject for many composers to write sacred music. Two versions by Schubert and Bach/Gounod seem to be the most popular. Here I am playing the Bach/Gounod's version.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The original piece has nothing remotely related to the concept of Mother Marie; it was the Prelude in C major from the first book of the Well-tempered Clavier by Bach. Later, Gounod found the opportunity to transform the music into something more biblical, and he added a new melody with lyrics to the almost-unchanged version of the orginal prelude (Ave Maria has one extra measure). You can clearly see in the video that I was playing the prelude, and the cello was playing the added melody.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To me, though the piece is pleasant to the ears, it is not exceptional. The new melody by Gounod accidentally hinder the listeners' ability to recognize the beauty of the original prelude, as they would be too busy focusing on the melody which really stands out from the midst of arpeggios. Nonetheless, the performance was a good experience and a nice touch for the end of the year.
