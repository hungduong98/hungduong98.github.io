<h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
    This was my first ever guitar competition. It was fun and nervewrecking at the same time. You can easily see I missed a considerable amount of notes there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The two pieces I chose were the two that I feel not too hard to screw everything up, but not too easy to be a joke. Sor's <em>Introduction, theme and variations</em> has always been one of my go-to pieces, while the <em>Fuga</em> by Ponce was completely new. I initially signed up with one piece by Barrios, the <em>Vals Op. 8 No. 4 in G major</em>, but I thought it would then be too technical demanding for me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You can have a look at the story about Sor's piece <a href="VarSorOp9-salon.html">here</a>. The <em>Fuga</em> by Ponce is the last movement of a bigger set of theme, variations and fugue on La Folia (there are 20 variations in this piece!). The most fundamental of playing a fugue is to highlight the subject, which I certainly did not do very well.
