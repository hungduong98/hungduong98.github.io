<h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
    It was toward the end of 2017, and this was my first time performing after not coming back to Vietnam for one year. I have always like playing Sor, and this piece would be one of my all-time favorites. I definitely experienced stage fright that night, but it was a value exposure. I also played two other encore pieces by Agustin Barrios, <em>Julia Floria</em> and <em>La Catedral</em>, but unfortunately they were not recorded.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The theme was taken from an opera by Mozart called <em>The Magic Flute</em> or <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>. However, it can be easily missed when listening to the opera for the first time, since Sor made numerous changes to the guitar version. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_and_Variations_on_a_Theme_by_Mozart_(Sor)">Wikipedia page</a> shall greatly help.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The <em>Introduction</em> starts in the key of E minor. Many people disagree with the inclusion of the introduction, as John Williams and Andrés Sogovia did not played the introduction; I, however, played for completion. The <em>Theme</em> now modulates to E major, simple (to set up for variations), nimble and very Mozart-like. <em>Variation 1</em> is even more energetic, with fast slurs and shifts, but still maintains the theme quite clear. <em>Variation 2</em> sets the tone to E minor, neutralize the emotions of the piece. <em>Variation 3</em>, now back to E major, is well-structure and relaxed. <em>Variation 4</em> involves the alternating between two (almost) separate voices, and is strict in terms of structure and rhythm. <em>Variation 5</em> is quite technical, with the increasing momentum in order to set the scene for the dramatic and orchestral <em>Finale</em>. Unquestionably guaranteed a fun piece to play any time.
