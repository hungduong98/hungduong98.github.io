    I am sucky with life. There are not so many things that make me happy, but there are countless things that drive me just wee bit crazy. Here are 10 things that I particularly dislike.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>1. Screw up my morning coffee.</b> Yes, I am a coffee person, but I'm in not because I need to be caffeinated, but because of the joy of making coffee. However, I don't like my coffee to taste like burnt cardboard, or if I fail the latte art.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>2. Wake up just a few minutes before morning alarm goes off.</b> I believe everyone has gone through this agony: I would have too little time to have another nap, but I wouldn't like to lose some sleep. The only thing that can save my is my coffee and as stated, I don't like it to be screwed up.

    <p>
    <b>3. Phone's dead when it clearly indicates there are more than 10% of battery.</b> Why can't you show the ACTUAL battery level please?
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>4. Somebody throw in a dirty dish while I'm washing and does not even feel guilty about it.</b> I'd be okay if one can say "I'm sorry" and do so. I feel guilty when I throw in extra work for other people as well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>5. Using metal utensils on non-stick frying pan.</b> The sound, the scratch, and the fact that you may lose the non-stick properties almost put the on edge. Using steel wool when washing counts too!
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>6. Working overtime with no notice.</b> Well, I understood that sometimes my place was understaffed, and I'd be happy to help out, but don't take it personally if I can't fulfill please, I have my own life as well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>7. Inconsistency in visuals in academic articles.</b> I am a big fan of data visualization for so many reasons, but I would be very happy if all graphs, charts, figures, etc go hand in hand with each other reagarding styles. Some stellar examples can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/162164557722128">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>8. Slightly out of tune instruments/singing.</b> The awkward intonation might not be perceptible to a number of people, especially to non-musician. For me, it's slightly uncomfortable to listen to, but I should reassure myself that "it's microtonal music".
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>9. My LaTeX file cannot be compiled, correctly.</b> Whether it's a coding error, or whether a grapic doesn't show up in the right way, or BibTex is not even working, I hate it, and I will have to revise about 1000 lines of codes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>10. Slow movie rendering time.</b> I'm using iMovie (I'm not ready to go for the big gun yet), and it is SLOW. The last time I exported a 1-hour video, it took me 20 hours, and I truly think that was not normal. Please give me some tips on how I can improve rendering time.
