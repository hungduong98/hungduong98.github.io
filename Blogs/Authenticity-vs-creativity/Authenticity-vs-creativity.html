    <h4>Authenticity versus creativity</h4>
    <h2>The debate</h2>
    <p>
    An ongoing and heated discussion in the music world is whether a performer should follow the instructions written by the composer (if the performer is not the composer him- or herself) or should implement his or her personal style in the playing of the piece. Although the question was simply phrased and thought to have no more than just the matter of individual preference, I believe there are more than meets the eye. Sure it can be explain as easy as "that's just the way I like it", but there could also exist explanations that would be more historically informed, systematic, generalized and widely-accepted. I would like to (hopefully) talk about different levels and dimensions of authenticity and creativity in musical performances, today.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    But first, it would be prudent to ask: what would be considered "authentic"? How can a musical piece attain the quality of being authentic, or orthodox, or original, or historically-accurate etc.? To clarify, authenticity here is not to denote music that is different, but to refer to the fact that historical music now might be played in a different approaches when comparing to historical musicians. While creativity are rather easy (easier compared to authenticity I would say) to define, the problem of authenticity remains convoluted. In the simplest way, is to view creativity as being diverted from what has been done or existed; and authenticity as the exact opposite. However, the rather profound issue is that we have no clues to how certain music was played before the invention of recordings, thus the most concrete evidence of authenticity is no longer in existence. With no evidence, we can only hypothesize what musicians could have and would have done based on lost-and-found unfinished manuscripts, chronologies of the composers which might have been written by highly-biased clerks or the music being performed through several generations. One way or another, the original integrity of the music is already compromised, and the value of authenticity is threatened. On the other hand, we can take a piece of music and play it in our way can already be called creative. But how much creativity is considered creative anyway? Would adding numerous trills to a Scarlatti sonata be considered creative? Or just alternating the way of playing trills enough to be called so? Or maybe only reharmonizing the whole Mahler symphony be considered significantly creative? I my view, authenticity and creativity might be the Kelvin temperature scale: one can have certain degree of creativity, but never achieve true authenticity.

    To tackle, we can apply an "area of authenticity" which makes room for musicians to perform authentically. While not being true authentic, we can still have the ability to observe and listen to how the music would have been played a few centuries ago, of course through the interpretative lens on available evidence by the performer. In a way, we are listening to what the performer thinks the composer would have wanted to achieve in a piece. Authenticity encompasses several dimensions not just in the methods of playing. After the span of a few hundreds years, almost everything would have changed, most evidently the use of instruments, pitches, musical philosophies, the employment of recordings and as mentioned, playing styles. I hope to address (to the least superficial) every aspect of historical performance.
