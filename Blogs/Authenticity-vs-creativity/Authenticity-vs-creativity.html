    <h4>Authenticity versus creativity</h4>
    <h2>The debate</h2>
    <p>
    An ongoing and heated discussion in the music world is whether a performer should follow the instructions written by the composer (if the performer is not the composer him- or herself) or should implement his or her personal style in the playing of the piece. Although the question was simply phrased and thought to have no more than just the matter of individual preference, I believe there are more than meets the eye. Sure it can be explain as easy as "that's just the way I like it", but there could also exist explanations that would be more historically informed, systematic, generalized and widely-accepted. I would like to (hopefully) talk about different levels and dimensions of authenticity and creativity in musical performances, today.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    But first, it would be prudent to ask: what would be considered "authentic"? How can a musical piece attain the quality of being authentic, or orthodox, or original, or historically-accurate etc.? To clarify, authenticity here is not to denote music that is different, but to refer to the fact that historical music now might be played in a different approaches when comparing to historical musicians. While creativity are rather easy (easier compared to authenticity I would say) to define, the problem of authenticity remains convoluted. In the simplest way, is to view creativity as being diverted from what has been done or existed; and authenticity as the exact opposite. I would also like to view authenticity as how the composer/creator wanted the piece to sound like. However, the rather profound issue is that we have no clues to how certain music was played before the invention of recordings, thus the most concrete evidence of authenticity is no longer in existence. With no evidence, we can only hypothesize what musicians could have and would have done based on lost-and-found unfinished manuscripts, chronologies of the composers which might have been written by highly-biased clerks or the music being performed through several generations. One way or another, the original integrity of the music is already compromised, and the value of authenticity is threatened. On the other hand, we can take a piece of music and play it in our way can already be called creative. But how much creativity is considered creative anyway? Would adding numerous trills to a Scarlatti sonata be considered creative? Or just alternating the way of playing trills enough to be called so? Or maybe only reharmonizing the whole Mahler symphony be considered significantly creative? I my view, authenticity and creativity might be the Kelvin temperature scale: one can have certain degree of creativity, but never achieve true authenticity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To tackle, we can apply an "area of authenticity" which makes room for musicians to perform authentically. While not being true authentic, we can still have the ability to observe and listen to how the music would have been played a few centuries ago, of course through the interpretative lens on available evidence by the performer. In a way, we are listening to what the performer thinks the composer would have wanted to achieve in a piece. Authenticity encompasses several dimensions not just in the methods of playing. After the span of a few hundreds years, almost everything would have changed, most evidently the use of instruments, pitches, musical philosophies, the employment of recordings and as mentioned, playing styles. I hope to address (to the least superficial) every aspect of historical performance.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The choice of instruments</h2>
    <p>
    One thing we cannot deny is the evolution of historical instruments into what we call to day modern. From the clavichord to the harpsichord then to the pianoforte; from the lute to the guitar to the electric guitar; from the recorder to the flute; from the trumpet to, the trumpet? Anyway, the instruments have changed, and so do their mechanics of creating sound, either expltcit or implicit. Take the harpsichord and the piano for instance: while the two looks strikingly similar with black and white keys (may be in inversted color), and we play by pressing the keys, the harpsichord would be considered a plucked instrument, whereas the piano would be percussion–not that the piano is a percussive instrument but the mechanism of sound generation is by hitting the strings with a hammer. So clearly, the sound is different, but should we say that a Bach tocatta performaed on a piano is any less authentic than the same piece played on the harsichord or an organ?
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Another problem arises when it comes to arranging and transcribing music to be played on other unrelated instruments. We have seen countless examples when a song is arranged for the solo guitar, or a violin piece be transcribed to fit the whole harmonic range of the piano (e.g., Chaconne from BWV 1004). First we ask if a music pertain authenticity when we play on a similar instrument but of the the future, now even with a completely distinct instrument? How authentic would that be?–Asked an authentic historical performance elitist. It seems that many people have a problem with old music to be played on new instrument, and unfortunately I think the reasons are entirely biased. One should provide the evidence to the argument why certain instruments could only be qualified to play certain music, rather than "I just like it that way". Otherwise, it is quite equally valid to say that any instrument could play any music.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Two issues presented so far, and there are not much of a distinction between the two question as they both refer to the choice of instrument. I might just give my thoughts as a whole. When it comes to playing of different instruments, I have an idea that I am very much convicted to:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
    It should not matter on which instrument we play, as long as the instrument works with what the music itself can offer, i.e., harmonies and techniques, and vice versa (the music should be played with what the instrument can offer, i.e., sonorities and tone qualities).
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
    I do agree that the statement provided cannot be any more general, but I believe it gives a reasonable argument. The Canadian pianist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38VMAfSmL8Q&t=894s">Glenn Gould</a> stated that there are two kinds of composers, those who devote themselves to creating the abosolute best music just for one instrument, those are Liszt and Chopin on the piano, Paganini on the violin, Barrios on the guitar etc. On the other hand, there are composers who focus on exceptional musical harmonies and structures, and that is it, with Bach being exemplary. The claim I made earlier on fits well with those on the latter side of the spectrum i.e. Bach, since he concentrated himself in composing music that is organized and pleasant to the eyes as well as the ears, rather than conceiving the ultimate piece for a specific instrument. Before Bach became a great composer as we know him as today, he was also known as one of the early arrangers by taking works from his precedents, such as Vivaldi or Marcelli, and transforming those pieces onto a different instrument (e.g., Vivaldi's L'estro Amonico Op. 3 No. 9 became Bach's BWV 972). Later on, not only did he adopt pieces from other composers,  there are numerous instances that he even recycled his own works: BWV 1011 on the cello versus BWV 995 on the lute; BWV 1006 on the violin versus BWV 1006a for the lute versus Simfonia from BWV 29 on the keyboard; various instrumental versions of The Art of Fugue, so on and so forth. Clearly, he was the most pragmatic man and did not care (or would not care) which instrument should a piece be played on. If one even bother come to realize that during Bach's time, or maybe Baroque period entirely, such prominent composers would have to traveled (and not in a minimalistic way) to various regions to, likely, commission a piece for the reigner of that regions. Since they would have to be adapted to the local instrument, the use of instrument for their music now became less relevant. While sonorities are still important, one's imagination on the scaffolding of the music should be the major focus. Even before the Baroque, music would be composed in a way that can be performed at any events and any musical ensembles serving as background music, partitas or dance tunes for the royals.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    So far we have address the second type of composer; how about the former type? Certainly since the music was intentionally written for the piano, so should that music be played on the piano only? Think about it this way, if that music can be part of the new repertoire for the piano, could it contribute to the guitar as a new guitar piece, rather than viewing it as a guitar-esque display of a piano piece? As I said earlier, using the piano to guitar example, the guitar offers some sonorities and timbres that could work well with the tonal characteristic of the music, however, as well as some parameters that are, well, not suitable to the music. At this point, I think it is quite clear that some particular music may never be, or could never be (technically speaking), transcribed to another instrument even if one desires very much. For example, transcribing a whole symphony to a small and dynamically-limited instrument such as the guitar, would be a challenging task, but not that it has never been done before (see Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky, on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq7Qd9PSmR0">orchestra</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVIFQmlccC4">guitar</a>). As for music that works well on both original instrument and the novel instrument, we can all have a look at Liszt's transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies on the piano (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz6J4wsfHkM">Symphony No. 5</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLktsyFf_QI">Symphony No. 6</a>). In some cases, the new instrument could serve a better justice to the music, for that the music was written, not poorly, but rather out-of-league for the original instrument. Looking at the three sonatas on the violin BWV 1001, 1003 and 1005 by Bach, the violin, normally preceived as a leading, monophonic and melodic instrument, now has to play three extended fugues in which sometimes there are up to four voices simultaneously. All three sonatas (and three partitas to complete the whole solo violin compilation), have been transcribed to the guitar, which are more appropriate in playing big chords as well as bringing out the polyphonic textures of the pieces. Obviously, really it should not matter which instrument we play the music on, what matters is that we can use the instrument as a tool to process and convey the gist of the piece into something meaningful and beautiful, within the ability of that instrument, and the piece become a part of the repertoire for the new instrument. I only think that it is fallacious and overreacting to view an arrangement as a limited backup or an alternative to the "authentic" version.
