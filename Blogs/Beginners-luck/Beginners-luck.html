 <h4>Beginner's luck: Cognitive disposition, bias, or true luck?</h4>
    
    <p>
    Beginner's luck is not uncommonly known. People may have not heard of it, but certainly have experienced it in different forms. One probably went through a situation when they expected newcomers to preform worse, but instead ultimately outperformed. For example, I play fairly good table tennis, but sometimes I lost brutally to a guy who said "it's my first time playing". Mostly seen in sport, gambling and occasionally in academic environment. As defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, beginner's luck describes "unexpected success experienced by a person who is just starting a particular activity". It is a phenomenon that is well-known, but not well-understood. I'm also writing this to share my discussion about the phenomenon (superficially), and not to investigate and explore what and how and why beginner's luck happens.

<h2>Is it luck?</h2>
    <p>
    Unfortunately, I don't believe in luck that much. Even though as much as I am aware that the previous statement might be an argumentative fallacy (special pleading or personal incredulity), there are multiple factors and explanation why such phenomenon could not happen due to mere luck, or in other word, chance. If beginners tend to win only by chance, it would have happened somewhat predictably and normally, thus not a phenomenon.
