        <h4>The phenomenon of internet memes in education on mainstream media</h4>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
    Now learning is moreimportant than ever. Learn to at least know, learn to develop, learn to be a better human being. Also, now knowlegde is more accessible than ever, but I would certainly say only to an extent. (We still have to pay a fee which I wouldn't consider cheap to read research articles.) What I meant by accessible is that one does not need to go to school or spend thousads of dollars to study in college, but he or she can sit at home and still be able to gain knowledge from various sources. I am refering to YouTube, Facebook and other social media. I wish to exclude serious institutional website since they are, obviously, serious and would leave no space to talk about the phenomenon of memes in educational context, though they are truly valuable in terms of contents. However, as much as the education environment is rigourous, stressful and unforgiving, sometimes educators, or I here I would use the words researchers scientists interchangeably, accidentally create a resevoir  for internet humors, which can even be scientifically correct and insightful. I just found this observation fascinating, and I shall talk about it now.
    </p>


    <h2>The identification of humor in educational contexts</h2>
    <p>
    Rarely do I have an observation that is original, not even mention revolutionary. Nonetheless, I can firmly say that I notice the manifestation of internet humor before encountering any formal research, so I think I can safely say at least the thought is original to me. There have already been a number of studies about the implications of memes as a <a href="http://oaji.net/articles/2014/1543-1418693209.pdf">tool</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314866526_Incorporating_Memes_and_Instagram_to_Enhance_Student's_Participation">destressor</a> to be used by educators in teaching <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1326365X19842023?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.1&">English</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331639939_MEANINGS_IN_MATHEMATICS_USING_INTERNET_MEMES_AND_AUGMENTED_REALITY_TO_PROMOTE_MATHEMATICAL_DISCOURSE">mathematics</a>, or teaching in general.
