    <h4>Silences in music</h4>
    <blockquote>
    “Sometimes the sound of silence is the most deafening sound of all.” – K. L. Toth
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Music can be perceived as organized sounds. And when we mention sound, we think of what we can perceive through the ability of hearing. However, often the importance of silience is overlooked, as audience usually focus too much on the beauty of of the audible sound, while not paying attention to the use of silence by the player. Though the last statement directs the issue toward listeners, it is equall crucial to address that musicians sometimes take silence for granted as well, and although it mey not make the music uglier, it may impede the process of elevating the music to another level.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As much as I wanted to write a comprehensive view on this, I thought this small piece would do for now. Here I justify why silence is an integral part in music, explain how silence affect one's performance of the piece, and lastly discuss each type of silence, from the shortest to the longest units.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Music as an intergral part of music</h2>
    <p>
    Take mathematics as an example. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks invented the numerical system, and later the Romans creat a writing system (I, II, III, IV, etc) that we still use up to now. They were all invented and used for one sole purpose: to count and manipulate the count. They were very much traders back then, therefore having a way to calculate how many/how much would be beneficial (no one wants to have a negative net income at the end of the day, however the concepts of positivity/negativity had not yet to exist). However, there was no mathematical concept of nothing-ness at the time, or at least was not very developed. To be more specific, using the Egyptians, Greek and the Romans: The Egyptians had a symbol to denote zero balance; the Greeks used alphebetical symbol as an alternative to numerical system (1 = &alpha;, 2 = &beta;, 3 = &gamma;, etc), and they were skeptical about the concept of 0, whether it was real or not (how can 0 be real if it denotes nothing?, and because of this undefined concept of 0, there were so many paradoxes related to limits, e.g., Achilles and the turtle). We are talking about the concept of true nothing-ness (as nothing, void, null, none), and not just numerical placeholder. There was a quite long gap between 2000 BC and 600 AD when the number 0 was formally documented. As a result, we now consider the number is by far the most important, at a level when infinity was introduced. The number 0 is essential for complex mathematical manipulations such as differentiation/integration, limits, propabilities, etc.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Similarly, replacing sounds with natural numbers other than 0 (yes, precisely because sound is something, and these numbers show something and not nothing). Because silence can be perceived as the lack of sound, i.e., the lack of music, i.e., nothing in music, it is suitable for silence to be assigned a value of 0. Now it may start to make sense. You cannot have music without just a bit of silence. It is the silence that makes the sounds speak, and it is also the silence that can stop the sounds. In other words, if you stop playing, that means you introduce silence, and the silence has its own musical value in it (If you are skeptical, refer to the reference about the Greek I made before). If one can control how to introduce silence in his or her playing, they can truly control the whole aspect of playing.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Silence at work</h2>
    <p>
    The stage is filled with silence. The silence is just as intimidating as the audience before you. Although this type of silence is not the absolute silence that I was talking earlier, it is still slience as there is no music. Occasionally interupted with people moving their chairs, or by the coughs they make, or just the murmurs, this silence can make you feel overwhelmed as if you could hear that they are talking about you. You start playing, and the sound breaks the silence; but you can still feel its ubiquity and omnipresence. While playing, the silence amplifies every move you make, augments every mistake you bump into, and all those factors are taken into account by the very sensitive audience. After you end the piece, if the listeners unfortunately don't know the piece very well, you will have to endure a rather awkward and deafening pause, where you expect people to clap or do something to reduce the intensity of that silence. From my own experience, it is even more agonizing if the piece ends dramatically and nobody claps. For a moment, I second guess myself whether I played well enough, or whether the audience appreciated the music I was delivering or not. Either way, it was unpleasant. As you can see, silence is just more than the lack of sound. It is contained by the performance, and contains the performance itself.

    <p>
    So that was a light touch on the subject. After this, I shall discuss more in-depth each type of silence according to its time length, from the shortest silence to the longest.

    <h2>Silences in musical performances – In the scores</h2>
    <p>
    <b>Rests.</b> This would probably the most well-recognized and used silence in music, and anyone playing music should know. A rest symbol, with its corresponding note value, indicates how long an absence of sound should occur. One of the functions of rests is to divide the music into "digestible chunks", i.e., phrase the music. This is similar to pausing in dialogues. A sentence might be incomprehensible or misleading if the punctuation (or pause) were absent or put in the wrong place. A misplaced rest would make a music unorganized and unpleasant. Another exaple to give, in Bach's music, he wrote a set of two-part contrapuntal <i>15 Inventions</i>. One can imagine the use of dialogue in this music, where part 1 is speaker 1 and part 2 is speaker 2. Rarely in a conversation do we see two speakers speak at the same time. That would be chaotic. Speaker/part 1 be silent while speaker/part 2 speaks, thus creating dialogue. Of course then was different than now, as now composers are freer in their domain of music with experimentation and innovation, but the use of rests should remain a necessity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Legato, Non-legato & Staccato.</b> The use here is probably a bit more nuanced than the mentioned rests. We can view each articulation as a pair of sound and silence, only with different proportion: legato = 100% sound, non-legato = 35% to 65% sound + silence, staccato = 10% sound + silence (these numbers are arbitrary). The use of staccato is often important in emphasizing the rhythms of the music, as seen in syncopations in many dances. This might have to do with the assumption that legato emphasizes melodies, and staccato emphasizes beats. A drum set is used to maintaining the steady rhythm in a band, since the drums produce sudden and aquickly-decaying sounds, which indicates very clearly which beat it is (just like the second hand on a clock). Articulating between these playing styles can be a tremendous feat, and the resulting effects can greatly influence how the music sounds and should be felt. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Fermata.</b> I have been wondering for quite a long time: How long shoulld I (or one ) should hold the note for? A series of related questions came up: Would the duration of the fermata be dependent on my credos, or would this be determined by some arbitrary indicators marked by the composer? If a section is marked rubato, does a fermata make a difference at all? How to play notes surrounding the fermata, faster, slower, or consistent?... All these questions are valid, and I tried not to dive too deep into them. For the guitar, and I may take the liberty of generalizing the following statement to other non-sustainable instruments (e.g., piano, harp), one cannot hold for too long. The sound created from these instruments is unfortunately quickly diminished and ultimately ended in silence. The fermata here can be thought as a <i>diminuendo</i>, where notes slowly reduce in volume, this time a note or a chord instead of a passage. If one can only hold for so long, then the rest of the hold is technically silence. How long should we hold this silence for? This question I cannot answer. I have been experimenting with both the extremes (very short hold as if staccato, and very long as if they are two separate paragraphs in an essay) and almost everything within the spectrum. It is not surprising to say that each interpretation gave a different feel, therefore justifying the variety of this articulation. I may even say that one doesn't have to play these fermatas consistently, in other words, you can play a long fermata on Monday and a short one on Friday. There are no guidelines, as long as they are in "acceptable" and comfort zone. An over-extended fermata only brings awkwardness to the performance, and as I mentioned, the silence may devour you on stage.
