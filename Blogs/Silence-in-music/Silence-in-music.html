    <h4>Silences in music</h4>
    <blockquote>
    “Sometimes the sound of silence is the most deafening sound of all.” – K. L. Toth
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Music can be perceived as organized sounds. And when we mention sound, we think of what we can perceive through the ability of hearing. However, often the importance of silience is overlooked, as audience usually focus too much on the beauty of of the audible sound, while not paying attention to the use of silence by the player. Though the last statement directs the issue toward listeners, it is equall crucial to address that musicians sometimes take silence for granted as well, and although it mey not make the music uglier, it may impede the process of elevating the music to another level.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As much as I wanted to write a comprehensive view on this, I thought this small piece would do for now. Here I justify why silence is an integral part in music, explain how silence affect one's performance of the piece, and lastly discuss each type of silence, from the shortest to the longest units.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Music as an intergral part of music</h2>
    <p>
    Take mathematics as an example. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks invented the numerical system, and later the Romans creat a writing system (I, II, III, IV, etc) that we still use up to now. They were all invented and used for one sole purpose: to count and manipulate the count. They were very much traders back then, therefore having a way to calculate how many/how much would be beneficial (no one wants to have a negative net income at the end of the day, however the concepts of positivity/negativity had not yet to exist). However, there was no mathematical concept of nothing-ness at the time, or at least was not very developed. To be more specific, using the Egyptians, Greek and the Romans: The Egyptians had a symbol to denote zero balance; the Greeks used alphebetical symbol as an alternative to numerical system (1 = &alpha;, 2 = &beta;, 3 = &gamma;, etc), and they were skeptical about the concept of 0, whether it was real or not (how can 0 be real if it denotes nothing?, and because of this undefined concept of 0, there were so many paradoxes related to limits, e.g., Achilles and the turtle). We are talking about the concept of true nothing-ness (as nothing, void, null, none), and not just numerical placeholder. There was a quite long gap between 2000 BC and 600 AD when the number 0 was formally documented. As a result, we now consider the number is by far the most important, at a level when infinity was introduced. The number 0 is essential for complex mathematical manipulations such as differentiation/integration, limits, propabilities, etc.

    Similarly, replacing sounds with natural numbers other than 0 (yes, precisely because sound is something, and these numbers show something and not nothing). Because silence can be perceived as the lack of sound, i.e., the lack of music, i.e., nothing in music, it is suitable for silence to be assigned a value of 0. Now it may start to make sense. You cannot have music without just a bit of silence. It is the silence that makes the sounds speak, and it is also the silence that can stop the sounds. In other words, if you stop playing, that means you introduce silence, and the silence has its own musical value in it (If you are skeptical, refer to the reference about the Greek I made before). If one can control how to introduce silence in his or her playing, they can truly control the whole aspect of playing.

    <h2>Silence at work</h2>
    <p>
    The stage is filled with silence. The silence is just as intimidating as the audience before you. Although this type of silence is not the absolute silence that I was talking earlier, it is still slience as there is no music. Occasionally interupted with people moving their chairs, or by the coughs they make, or just the murmurs, this silence can make you feel overwhelmed as if you could hear that they are talking about you. You start playing, and the sound breaks the silence; but you can still feel its ubiquity and omnipresence. While playing, the silence amplifies every move you make, augments every mistake you bump into, and all those factors are taken into account by the very sensitive audience. After you end the piece, if the listeners unfortunately don't know the piece very well, you will have to endure a rather awkward and deafening pause, where you expect people to clap or do something to reduce the intensity of that silence. From my own experience, it is even more agonizing if the piece ends dramatically and nobody claps. For a moment, I second guess myself whether I played well enough, or whether the audience appreciated the music I was delivering or not. Either way, it was unpleasant. As you can see, silence is just more than the lack of sound. It is contained by the performance, and contains the performance itself.

    So that was a light touch on the subject. After this, I shall discuss more in-depth each type of silence according to its time length, from the shortest silence to the longest.
