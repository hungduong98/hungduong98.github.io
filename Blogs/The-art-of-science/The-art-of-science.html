    <h4>The art of science (and the science of art)</h4>
    
    <p>
    Science and art have been viewed by many as two separate, or even opposite, entities: Science is often associated with highly successful academic individuals, daunting terminologies, tidious and laborious labworks, or simply those who devote their entire life to research; on the other hand, art is thought to be intuitive, innate, determined by talents, and low-paid jobs (musicians for example, although this is considered a bad one and is not even true at all). These stereotypes are nonetheless could not be any further than the truth. In fact, science and art are not even opposite; they are only different aspects to what a person may pursue in their career. How I view and break the assumptions is that science contains some kind of art domain, and similarly, there are some kind of science domain in art.
    </p>
    
    <h2>But first, let's break the stereotypes of science subjects and scientists</h2>
    <p>
    If you ask any Asian parent (although this is also highly stereotypical, and I am sorry for that) what science is involed or what scientists do, there is a high chance that they will say: <br>
    "Probably they work in a lab, mixing chemicals or work with lasers. If they are mathematicians then what else do they need apart from pen and paper..."<br>
    "They studied either math, physics, chemistry or biology, or any combination of those."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    That's the bitter truth. I don't know very well how people from other parts of the world would respond to these questions, though I suspect the answers would be similar. This reflects the stereotypes I mentioned just above: laboratory works, boring, repetitive, study in certain fields. Moreover, if I asked the same people what research is involved, they would answered basically the same thing. That means the research world, in the eyes of common public, is associated with math, physics, chemistry, biology, and if lucky, some may say medicine and pharmacy (Many people don't think health science is an actual science).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In actuality, science can be anything related to the systematic and structure studies of the natural world. Because the aforementioned fields demonstrate the clearest evidence for this kind of relationship (between the observative work and the natural world), it is expected that many people would believe those are the only ones in science. In addition, these fields are far more popular (or well-known) due to its world-changing implications; for instance, Tesla for alternated currents, Newton for gravitaional force, Gallileo for his heliocentric model, etc. Now let's name some world-changing invention/theory in other fields, say zoology or entomology. Very hard, right (?), and I can't even name more than five. It's because of this favored position of some highly-relevant fields that makes other field seemingly unimportant.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The fact is, as I said, anything can be science if it involves the systematic observation of the natural world, be it actual nature (physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, health, math, etc) or other kinds of nature (socialogy, psychology, philosophy, etc). And for any science subject, research can be done to widen the body of knowledge of that particular subject, or to build bridge to connect multiple subjects togeher (multi-, inter- and transprofessional research).
