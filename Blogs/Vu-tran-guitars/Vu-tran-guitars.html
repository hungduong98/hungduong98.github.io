        <h4>A day with luthier Vu Tran</h4>
    <p>
    I certainly knew, or rather heard, the sound of his guitar before getting to know him. In the few last weeks of 2018, I went back to Vietnam for some opportunities of live playing, but I never expected to meet and discuss a guitar of my own. On my first performance since the day I was back, one guitar that my friend used, which was indeed very well-made at first glance, and even more meticulously crafted when closely inpected, unlike any other Vietnamese guitars, intrigued me profoundly. Nonetheless, it was a shame that I didn't ask who the maker was on the same day. After a few occasions, I encounter the same guitar, and even more guitars made by that same maker, I presumed, as the headstocks of those guitar were the same. This time, I took the initiation of asking more about the guitars. The name Vu Tran definitely appeared in the intricate and sophiticated calligraphic label inside the guitar. Wow! A hand-written label, interesting. Even for famous luthiers, not many even have the dedication and talent to write such sublime texts. Unfortunately, I didn't get anything much about him except for this name. It's still a starting point though.

    So lucky that we have Facebook nowadays. After an "intensive" search of my friends' friendlists (sorry if I'm making myself like a stalker), he has a Facebook account. it might be a bit sudden and out of nowhere to message a stranger who you know so little about their personalities or preferences or whatsoever, and that was exactly what I did; and so did I only hope for the best. I cold sent him a brief text inquiring about his location, how he would prefer to get in touch and so forth with basic etiquette. What I did not expect was the fact that he was one of the most pleasant people I have ever known, and I will get back to this later.

    I got a ticket to Dalat immediately after I set a date with him.
