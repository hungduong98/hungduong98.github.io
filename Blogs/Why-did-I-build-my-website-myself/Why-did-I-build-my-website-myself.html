    <h4>Why I built my own website myself</h4>
    <p>
    This should have been my first blog in this page instead one about fingernails. Nowadays, it is "easy" to just get your own personal website, using any of the vast number of web design third parties, such as Wix, Squarespace, or Wordpress. I am not going to rant about the price they charge, nor do I want to insult people that they are not dedicated enough to make their own website (which can be the opposite, some of my friends owning a Wordpress site and have marvelous contents). In short, making my own website, for myself and by myself is to satisfy my hobby, and to simply have a playground where I can share aspects of my life to others.
