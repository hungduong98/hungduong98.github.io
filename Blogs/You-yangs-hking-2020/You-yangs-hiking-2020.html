 <h4>You Yangs hike 2020</h4>
    <p>
    Despite having a very Chinese name (not focusing toward racism), the hike locates near Little River (which is a town) in Victoria, Australia. It took us about an hour by car to get to the starting point of the path. The weather was fairly cold, fluctuated between 16°C and 22°C; however, after a short walk, the temperature gradually became perfect for the activity.

    There are three walks you can go, short (1-hour return), medium (2-hour return) and long (2.5-hour return). We had a whole day, although my feet was so sore for no particular reason, we decided to go for the 2.5-hour walk. We also brought enough water for the whole trip, and we were all physically and mentally geared up.

    We walked as fast as we could, I think. We took more than one hour to get to the peak of the hill, and we had some cool photos taken from the lookout. If only I brought my camera with me, since I took all the photos with my phone. What a bummer.

    We encountered an unexpected detour at the last few hundred meters. There were a three-way that we did not notice, resulting in an extra 45 minutes of walking. It was worth it though. We finally finished with some Indian dosa.

    <p>
    In my opinion, the hike is suitable for those who are new to hiking, but also be aware that there are tricky sections and may require additional help from other experience people. Always stay close to the designated path. Overall 3/5.
