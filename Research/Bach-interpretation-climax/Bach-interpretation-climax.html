     <!-- ABSTRACT -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    <em>Johann Sebastian Bach</em>, or J. S. Bach (1685 – 1750), is well-known as one of the most prominent composers of the Baroque period, if not of all time. With a massive volume of compositions, comprising of Cantatas, Sonatas, Organ works, Clavier works, Chamber music and music for other minor instruments. He was most known for his technique and extensive use in counterpoint (i.e., melodically independent but harmonically codependent). This technique is clearly evident in the two books of the <em>Well-tempered Clavier</em>, where he wrote a set of Preludes and Fugues encompassing all keys of the twelve tones. But there's more; just when we thought writing contrapunctally for key intruments was hard enough, he (J. S. Bach) was able to achieve the similar levels of polyphonic harmony for string intruments (i.e., cello and violin), which were thought would only serve the melodic/lyrical compoment of a music piece, or could only be polyphonic when played as an ensemmble.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The achievement I was referring to previously is the work for solo violin, numberred BWV 1001 to 1006. This big work consists of six smaller works, three sonatas and three partitas, with the numbering as the following:
    </p>
    <div class="listresearch">
        <ul>
        <li>Sonata No. 1 in G minor, BWV 1001</li>
        <li>Partita No. 1 in B minor, BWV 1002</li>
        <li>Sonata No. 2 in A minor, BWV 1003</li>
        <li>Partita No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1004</li>
        <li>Sonata No. 3 in C major, BWV 1005</li>
        <li>Partita No. 3 in E major, BWV 1006</li>
    </ul>
            </div>
    <p>
    In layman terms, a sonata is a work played by an instrument with different tempi or composition styles. For example, the second sonata BWV 1003 contains four movements: <em>Grave</em> (slow), <em>Fuga</em> (fugue), <em>Andante</em> (pacing), and <em>Allegro</em> (fast) in that order. A partita, on the other hand, is a set of Baroque dances, therefore rhythm being the major focus of a partita. Each dance may originate from different regions or/and have slight variations, which provide sufficient flexibility for Bach to compose. For instance, the second partita BWV 1004 has 5 movements: <em>Allemanda</em> (a German dance), <em>Corrente</em> (a French dance), <em>Sarabanda</em> (a Spanish dance), <em>Giga</em> (an Irish dance), and lastly <em>Ciaccona</em> (a Spanish dance). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Although all sonatas and partitas have been widely arranged for and played on the guitar, it is undeniable that the last movement of the second partita, i.e., the <em>Ciaccona</em> (used interchangably with Chaconne) from BWV 1004, is played the most. This could possibly be the a consequence from the "Segovia movement" in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The evolution of the guitar from a folk instrument to a concert instrument led by Andrés Segovia (1893 – 1987) resulted in a massive flux of new compositions and arrangements of early-period artists such as George Friderich Handel (1685 – 1759), Silvius Leopold Weiss (1687 – 1750) and Domenico Scarlatti (1685 — 1757). The Chaconne from the second violin partita definitely was not an exception. The premiere of Segovia's version of the Chaconne in 1935 brought his transcription to international recognition quite immediately (Wade, 1985). This transcription is the start for many more to come in the future, both in the style of Segovia and contemporary/modern era.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>The Segovia school.</b> Being one of the first guitarists to use fingernails rather than the fingertips, Segovia exploited the tone created by the nail to its full extend. Fast-plucked, sudden, projective chords were heard in almost every Segovia's playing. He was also quite (in)famous for his tone colors (mostly when play closer to the fretboard) and overly-executed vibrato. Additionally, the use of rubato was significantly recognizable compared to other artists. Some guitarists show Segovia's playing style include Christopher Parkening, Alex Park and Julian Bream.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>The modern school.</b> It is hard to describe this style of playing with the assumption that all guitarists in the same generation would play the same (homogeneity). In fact, it would be impossible to do so, due to the variety of educational curricula/development, or simply just the variety of subjective experience and execution of the piece by these artists. Therefore, it would be more reasonable to say that this school is different from the Segovia school, and that is it. However, it is still okay to have a broad description. Quite contrary to Segovia's style, the newer generation tended to focus on articulation, experimentation and "perfection", thus little rubato or "caressed" tone. With the popularity of guitar competitions, it is even more motivated to achieve such goals. These artists plays with modern style: John Williams, Thomas Viloteau, or Thibaut García.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Though I am aware that there has been a lot of subcatagorization so far (works for strings by bach, then six sonatas and partitias, then each contain several movements), the famous Chaconne also consists of two smaller parts: first part written in D minor, with a classic 3/4 rhythm of the chaconne dance, solemn and funeral-like; second part starts in D major, tranquil and serene, then ends back to D minor. For the purpose of this review, I excluded the first part of the Chaconne. The review only discussed the climatic section from the second part of the Chaconne. Since there are potentially many different interpretations of this section, this study aimed to collect, describe and characterize different executions by some famous guitarist. To my knowledge, there has been no paper compiling and analyzing at any level of this matter, thus justify the need for this study.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Bar 161 – 177 <em>(Figure 1)</em> would be the major focus for this review.

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>
    <b>Data collection.</b> I gather recordings following convenient sampling. Unlike written literature where there are keywords and therefore search strategies (in academic journals, there are even MeSH terms where you can expand and collapse terms!), there is simply no way to collect music other than by searching for the music manually and listen fully.
    </p>
    <p>
    I used the terms "Bach, Chaconne, Ciaccona, guitar" as my primary search. I looked for audios and videos on Spotify and YouTube/Vimeo respectively. After a few attempts, I decided that additional terms such as "BWV 1004" or "Violin Partita No. 2" did not pull any more results, or could even hypothetically reduce the number of results since these platforms tend to show results with the exact set of keywords. After finding as many possible results as possible, I searched for the same recording on Spotify for consistency when writing up the manuscript. I only included interpretations from "famous" guitarists, since they are likely to be more consistent (i.e., less varied from this recording to others). Amateurs, like myself, tend to change execution quite a few times.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Data analysis.</b> When thinking about the analysis, I came to the conclusion that since this study is only about the descriptive aspects, transcribing and analyzing the transcriptions would be the most suitable. In general, I slowly deconstructed all interpretations and analyzed them in terms of arrangements, melodic contours, rhythms, structures, timbers and qualities of recording.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It is ubdoutedly I had to listen to the original interpretation on the violin (I chose Jascha Heifetz's version as reference). Then for each guitar recording, I first listened with minimal engangement to the whole 15-minute piece as part of my enjoyment and to identify whether the arrangement "feels significantly different" or not. Those which are eligible will be included in the next phase: transcribing. I listen closely, this time with utmost attention, to bar 161 to 177 and write down the music. The transcription then would be used as an intermediate representation for analysis of structure and harmony.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
    <b>The original.</b> Heifetz stayed true to the piece (Audio 1). his Chaconne has been a long-standing, critically acclaimed version of the piece. Although there are critisisms (<a href="https://www.violinist.com/discussion/thread.cfm?page=457">here</a>), the online contributors did not commented anything other than some versions that they think "better" than Heifetz's. In my humble opinion, these arguments are merely their subjective preference and stay invalid, or at least inappliable to this situation of a performer of such caliber. Hoever, in fact, any of the violin interpretation of the Chaconne would be suitable as the reference of this review since the majority of them does not show significant deviation from the scores (maybe except tempo choices). For example, Hilary Hann, Yehudi Menuhin, or Isaac Stern.

    <p>
    <b>Why is this section the climax?</b> This small section locates after a melodic, lyrical section just after the beginning of the second part (in D major). Keeping up with the adoption of the Chaconne dance, although the "monophonic" writing in this [starting, bar 132 – 160] section may appear to be played fast and energetically, it would be more suitable to bridge the second part with the tempo used in the first D minor part (almost like a mirroring effect, and the because the structure of the first part suggest this would be a slow piece). Therefore the theme to the second part can be described as: slow, tranquil, serene, calm, peaceful. On a side note, if one decided to listen to the whole piece, apart from the positive feelings, there might be underlying unease, anger, fear or sadness. However, the section of interest suggest a gradual change in harmonic structure, from scales/arpeggios to repeated chords. Despite not being shown explicitly in the scores, the note A was frequently repeated througout this section, signifying the needs to recognize the emphasis on these "invisible chords". In the key of D major, A is the domniant. The whole section now alternates between three chords: D, A and E<sub>7</sub>. The E<sub>7</sub> chords magnify the effect of the A chords, building up tension, which further require the resolution to D at the end of this section. Because of this tension, and the resolution at bar 177, this section sets the climax for the second part of the Chaconne. Additionally, the range of voicing is now expanded, associated with quick jumps between high and low registers towards building up higher registers, plus the effect of repeated notes/chords, even make this section more dramatic and create a satisfying resolution <em>(Figure 2)</em>.

    </div>
    <p>
    Some may argue that the arpeggio section (bar 201 – 208) should be the climax. It can be. However, the effect is not as dramatic (arpeggios versus big chords), and this section serves as the transition back to D minor, so the resolution might not be as pronounced.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <b>Overall themes.</b> There were not so many interpretations that deviate strongly away from the original violin score. They usually kept the integrity of the original structures, notes and harmonies. That is, the main notes from the violin score could still be heard. The duration varied from 2 minutes 16 seconds (Paul Galbraith) to just shy of 50 seconds (John Williams). Such differences in playing duration happenned due to the choice of tempo rather than extra passages.

    <b>Andrés Segovia: The First.</b> Segovia's transcription of the monumental Chaconne was probably the first world-renowned, to say the least. Debuted on 4<sup>th</sup> June, 1935 in Paris, his Chaconne has since set the standards for future guitarists. With the privilege of the Internet, now we can easily access his version anywhere online <em>(Figure 3)</em>.

    Unfortunately, some "Bachian extremists" mercilessly criticized the novelty of the piece: Horror, profanation, disgrace, damnation, murder(!). Arranging the Chaconne from the violin to a different instrument is not uncommon back then. There were many famous composers who had already adapted the Chaconne for the piano (Brahms, Busoni), organ (again, Busoni) or the orchestra (Wilhelmj). Then why transcribing the same monumental work for the guitar was deemed wrong? To say that the Chaconne could only be played [emotionally-correct] on the violin just can't be any further than the truth. An article by Pincherle (1930) justified the marrying between the Chaconne and the guitar:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
    "In the case of the Chaconne, one might at times ask if Bach were not thinking of an instrument of the guitar family. It is surprising that he uses the key of D minor, which is the best key for guitar technique; also that he uses the succession of chords in the last two pages of this work - a succession that reproduces the harmonic scheme used frequently in popular Andalusian songs. And who knows whether the Iberian origin of the Chaconne did not inspire Bach with the idea of using a typically Spanish instrument which he knew and which the masters of time - DeVisee, Campion, Courbet, etc., played?<br>
    But the most convincing argument in favor of the Segovia transcription is that it can scarcely be called a transcription. By a singular coincidence (if the preceding hypotheses are not facts) the violin version has no need of any change in order to be played on the guitar. On the contrary, there is on the guitar a fuller realization of those compact chords and those "imitations" which the violin essays to conquer."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
    The relationship between the guitar and Bach was yet to be found defenitive however (Wade & Garno, 2000). Though it is true that the notes from the violin score can be played directly on the guitar (we will revisit this later), Segovia did not choose this method. The sound would be too thin since the guitar cannot sustain the notes as long as the string counterpart can. He played with the guitar's forte (pardon the musical pun): chords and polyphony, and this is even more applicable to this section where there definitely chords and polyphony. He added the bass notes (A, which can be played very naturally on the guitar) to indicate the 3/4 rhythm of the chaconne dance; he wrote a one or two more voices, especially when the guitar reaches higher notes (bar 171 – 176), ultimately inevitably created chords. These chords would be impossible to play on the violin without severe cross-trings, or a specially-made straight-fretboard violin, and that's how this version of the Chaconne is a hallmark piece for classical guitar.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There is one problem for the guitar, however, is the fingerings. Segovia stated in an interview that "every instrument of the orchestra is inside the guitar, but in smaller sound size. It has many different colors and timbres, and it is necessary to develop these qualities of the instrument" (Nupen, 1967). The fingerings, i.e., where on the intrument to play the notes, is the determining factor for the timbres. During the conception of the Chaconne, he must have thought about the production of very specific sounds since Bach's Chaconne is not simply just a piece for violin, remembering it was written not long after his wife Maria passed away, therefore to convey the certain appropriate feels about the piece. He insisted on keeping the fingering so much, even told by one of his students, Christopher Parkening (92nd Street Y, 2015):
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
    "I chose to play the 'single greatest piece every written' (the Chaconne) for Andrés Segovia on the third day. I got about a third of the way through the Chaconne, and the next thing I heard was his foot smashing to the ground. Then I stopped playing. I looked up and saw his hands were over his head, and he said 'Why did you change the FINGERINGS?'. His wife was holding him back, and I was melting. He was furious with me."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
    Segovia could be quite intimidating, and even more so imagining one being his direct student. It could be because of his demand on keeping the fingering, along with the techniques on the guitar, it seemed that almost all his students displayed the Segovian style: Christopher, as we talked, Elliot Fisk or Brigitte Zaczech.

    Dynamics marking was very explicit in this transcription as well <em>(Audio 2)</em>. A gradual crescendo starts at bar 167, increasing slowly the <em>dramatique</em> of the section. Accented bass notes was clearly a Segovia trademark. His thumb was big and curved, which is very suitable and convenient for producing deep, loud basses <em>(Figure 4)</em>.

    Generally speaking, despite being controversial, Segovia's Chaconne has changed the way we view the classical guitar, and opened so many possibilities for composing for the guitar.
